00:00.950 --> 00:07.590
Let us see how to install X code on Mac OS X operating system.

00:07.700 --> 00:11.340
See Google AppStore an insight App Store.

00:11.360 --> 00:17.760
Search for X cool already I have X called installed on this machine.

00:17.760 --> 00:25.330
See here's X gold option is available for updating it so if I have to update I can update it.

00:25.340 --> 00:31.350
If it is not installed then this button will be for installation of X code so you can take on this one

00:31.350 --> 00:38.480
and install X called on your machine and the other method of installing X quarters to determine on a

00:38.570 --> 00:43.020
command line see X called Select

00:45.730 --> 00:47.160
install.

00:47.290 --> 00:51.060
See here the message I'm getting is command line tools are already installed.

00:51.400 --> 00:55.920
You software update to install updates so already X code is unreliable.

00:56.110 --> 01:03.520
If it is not available then it will install it once it is installed you can start using it scored.

01:03.850 --> 01:07.700
So first of all I will show you how to create a new project for C language.

01:07.750 --> 01:11.170
Then later I will show you how to create a project for C++.

01:11.170 --> 01:15.900
The method is similar just we have to select the language at the time of creating a project.

01:15.940 --> 01:22.830
So let us create a new project for click on the file mental and see new and inside that new option.

01:22.840 --> 01:30.160
There is an option available called Project so say a new project and here it opens and it will ask which

01:30.160 --> 01:31.300
type of project you want.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.050
So here we are.

01:32.050 --> 01:38.260
I didn't come online application so select come on line but then it will ask for the project names who

01:38.260 --> 01:43.450
again mentioned any project name like I will say first project is my first I will call it as my first

01:43.840 --> 01:46.970
then I will select the language as C language.

01:47.020 --> 01:51.820
Here you can see in the dropdown there are more than 1 languages available so we can select C as the

01:51.820 --> 01:53.420
last C++ also.

01:53.590 --> 01:58.140
So I'll be using the same idea for writing the programs using C language as well as C++.

01:58.540 --> 02:02.050
So let us select C language and see next.

02:02.050 --> 02:07.540
Now here it allows the destination folder where you have to create a project so you can select any folder

02:07.570 --> 02:09.910
where you want your projects to be stored.

02:10.300 --> 02:14.660
So C create no new project is created.

02:15.550 --> 02:18.760
So these are the general properties of the projects on the left hand side.

02:18.770 --> 02:25.600
But here is the project browser that is File Explorer so you can click on the file that is may not see

02:26.690 --> 02:27.130
ya.

02:27.130 --> 02:32.740
Here is the ready made source code given for writing the basic program and also comments are data.

02:32.740 --> 02:38.200
So if you don't want you can remove these comments and inside the main function also some time inside

02:38.220 --> 02:39.480
that I remove them.

02:39.890 --> 02:40.340
Yeah.

02:40.360 --> 02:44.270
Here is a perfect C language main function.

02:44.270 --> 02:46.150
Now by default some things are done here.

02:46.150 --> 02:47.470
That is print Hello World.

02:47.800 --> 02:55.370
So if I run the program which will print Hello World so let us run the program and see and here's the

02:55.370 --> 02:56.110
output window.

02:56.130 --> 03:01.670
Hell a wall is displayed and later on the program ends with exit code 0 so the program has terminated

03:02.150 --> 03:05.720
no on these left hand side right hand side we have the bar.

03:05.720 --> 03:11.210
So if you want to remove the bots you can go on the right top corner of the screen and you can hide

03:11.210 --> 03:17.870
these panels so you can hide these panels and even you can hide this output but again you can open it

03:17.870 --> 03:20.440
up you can pop it up or you can hide it.

03:20.600 --> 03:27.860
So this all this all we can start our new project and we can develop the project no let us go through

03:27.860 --> 03:35.510
this no let us go to the project panel not inside this if you want to add a new finds like if you have

03:35.510 --> 03:41.480
to include any header files you can include them here you can just say right click and a pop up you

03:41.490 --> 03:47.980
can see a new file and you can select the file type that you want to include in this project so sometime

03:47.990 --> 03:54.320
we may be using header files so we can pop up this header file and the benefit of using x scored is

03:54.320 --> 04:00.380
that we can easily debug the program and see it's working line by line so I can add a breakpoint here

04:00.710 --> 04:05.100
so there's a break and if I run the program it will come down to this line and stop.

04:05.100 --> 04:07.670
So up to here it will run and it will stop

04:10.400 --> 04:10.990
yeah.

04:11.070 --> 04:16.860
Here it is a debug area you can see the contents of the variables that are used inside the function

04:16.860 --> 04:17.870
or inside the program.

04:18.450 --> 04:22.370
So it's easy for me to explain the working of a program.

04:22.380 --> 04:24.030
So far my explanation.

04:24.150 --> 04:25.670
I I'm using x code.

04:25.920 --> 04:29.540
You can use any ideas for developing your applications.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.130
So throw this course.

04:31.170 --> 04:32.870
I'll be using x code.

04:32.880 --> 04:36.530
The reason I have told you so I can explain you the things more clearly.

04:37.650 --> 04:38.570
That's it.

04:38.630 --> 04:44.740
Next I will show you how to create a C++ project great new school project

04:47.610 --> 04:49.130
and let it be.

04:49.140 --> 04:51.290
Come on line tool.

04:51.440 --> 04:54.770
Next on here select the language as a C++.

04:54.780 --> 05:01.150
There are other languages salts available so I'll give the project name as my first.

05:01.190 --> 05:07.620
I was asking for the destination that this project should be stored so select the destination folder.

05:08.550 --> 05:15.960
Now the project is created and this is the program he here already hello world program was created so

05:15.960 --> 05:19.760
you can remove the comments and here you can start writing your code.

05:20.890 --> 05:22.870
So let us run this one and check

05:25.670 --> 05:26.990
here in this window.

05:27.030 --> 05:28.400
The output is displayed.

05:28.670 --> 05:30.950
So if you want you can remove this panels

05:33.830 --> 05:39.120
and hear the output as you can extend or the size of this one.

05:39.380 --> 05:43.110
So this the watch window where you can see the contents of the variables.

05:43.130 --> 05:48.860
If you have any variables in your program and this is the output window so you can show and hide this

05:48.950 --> 05:51.390
output window from this toolbar that's it.

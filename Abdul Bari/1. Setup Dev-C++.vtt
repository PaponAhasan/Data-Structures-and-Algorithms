00:00.440 --> 00:02.910
Let us see how you download Dev C++.

00:03.030 --> 00:14.820
So for Dev C++ you can in Chrome or in any browser you can see download Dev C++ and get many links and

00:14.820 --> 00:22.080
one of the link is for from bloodshed and dot net which you can go to bloodshed darknet and from here

00:22.080 --> 00:30.690
you can download Dev C++ Dev C++ that is beta version 5.0 is available here it is vitamin GW that is

00:30.690 --> 00:38.040
with compiler or just without compiler that is executable only and so scored is also available so you

00:38.040 --> 00:40.510
can download any one of these of your choice.

00:40.530 --> 00:46.280
So if you install vitamin GW then you can immediately start using Dave C++.

00:47.100 --> 00:53.100
Otherwise you have to install compiler separately that is minimal G and your compiler for windows you

00:53.100 --> 01:03.040
have to download it separately so click on this one and start downloading it will start downloading.

01:03.050 --> 01:11.020
Yeah once it has finished downloading you can install Dev C++ software and you can directly use it.

01:12.270 --> 01:15.510
After downloading install Dev C++

01:32.400 --> 01:34.690
it has finished installation.

01:34.860 --> 01:45.750
If I show you the folder where Dev C++ is installed this isn't C and program files and here is Dev CPB

01:46.040 --> 01:53.390
so you can see that it is also installed Min GW that is General compiler for Windows.

01:53.390 --> 01:57.230
This is a minimal compiler for Windows at a start date.

01:57.230 --> 02:06.990
C++ so English language is selected the next then okay for developing data structure programs.

02:07.010 --> 02:10.260
We may be using C language as well as some programs.

02:10.260 --> 02:16.880
I'll be showing you using C++ so for opening a new project using C language select file option and see

02:16.880 --> 02:18.930
a new and select project

02:22.050 --> 02:27.300
and here we have to select a console application and you can see the language options are given.

02:27.300 --> 02:32.280
That is a language option for C language as well as C++ so whichever language you are using you can

02:32.280 --> 02:37.830
select that language so first of all I'll show you how to create a C language project then also I will

02:37.830 --> 02:42.390
also show you how to create a C++ project in C language project.

02:42.390 --> 02:48.000
I'll give the project name as my first see as the project name.

02:48.140 --> 02:48.510
Okay

02:51.660 --> 02:56.540
a loss for the location or the folder in which you want to create this project so you can select some

02:56.750 --> 02:57.760
folder.

02:57.770 --> 03:02.960
Now the readily available code is given so a required code the minimal code is given.

03:03.520 --> 03:07.260
And here in the project you can see that this is mean Ghazi fine.

03:07.310 --> 03:09.920
This is the contents of main Nazi file.

03:09.920 --> 03:15.480
Already a CDI ordered edge and a lib outage header files are already included in the main function results.

03:15.650 --> 03:16.250
Also there.

03:16.700 --> 03:19.470
So here I will write a message that is print.

03:20.240 --> 03:25.410
Hello world.

03:26.020 --> 03:28.380
Let us see how to run the program.

03:28.840 --> 03:31.840
So go to execute option and save what's to come by.

03:33.900 --> 03:34.090
Yeah.

03:34.100 --> 03:40.420
This compiler then you can go to execute option and you can also press f 10 for running the program

03:40.670 --> 03:43.430
so run the program.

03:43.430 --> 03:43.920
Yeah.

03:43.930 --> 03:48.710
Here is the console window where you can see your hello world message is displayed.

03:48.970 --> 03:55.800
C++ also prompt a console window showing you the output.

03:56.500 --> 04:01.630
If there are any errors then that will appear in the log so you can remove the errors by checking the

04:01.630 --> 04:02.900
log messages.

04:03.160 --> 04:06.900
She removed the semicolon for print f and I will compile and show you.

04:07.090 --> 04:09.090
Let us see what happens here.

04:09.090 --> 04:14.520
Here is an error message who is showing the error message in the log window ie checking the error messages.

04:14.520 --> 04:15.460
You can remove that.

04:15.490 --> 04:21.040
So here the message is that X burglar semicolon before it done so yes before written there should be

04:21.040 --> 04:22.370
semicolon.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.400
No it will work perfectly.

04:24.400 --> 04:25.200
So that's it.

04:25.210 --> 04:27.460
We have already seen how to run it now.

04:27.510 --> 04:34.390
Next I'll be showing you a project in C++ the steps are seem just we have to select a language that

04:34.390 --> 04:42.360
is C++ C a new project and select some application.

04:42.370 --> 04:44.830
Let the project name as my first

04:47.460 --> 04:50.770
and it should be created in documents.

04:50.830 --> 04:52.640
Now the project is ready.

04:52.650 --> 04:55.460
This is meant CPB file inside the project.

04:55.470 --> 05:05.940
So here I'll just give a message Hello World and and then they should use namespace for C out as allies

05:06.210 --> 05:13.230
and then let us build a project and execute.

05:13.360 --> 05:14.710
Hello world is up here.

05:15.760 --> 05:21.130
So that's all this all you can open a new project for every program or application you can start a new

05:21.130 --> 05:23.470
project or else for practicing in the same project.

05:23.470 --> 05:27.790
You can go on writing new code there and you can recompile and run it.

00:01.050 --> 00:06.790
For developing programs for that structure we vehicle will be using C or C++ languages.

00:06.810 --> 00:15.840
So far that requires some iodine e and also you need a compiler so for ITV choose ideas that this code

00:15.840 --> 00:16.450
blocks.

00:16.470 --> 00:25.810
So let us see how good on Lord code blocks open chrome and see download code blocks.

00:26.310 --> 00:29.690
So good block start or G does that you are.

00:29.720 --> 00:32.190
So if you want you know that you order.

00:32.610 --> 00:37.170
So if you want you can radically go to this you are the discord blog start towards you slash downloads

00:37.950 --> 00:39.690
and download three options out there.

00:39.690 --> 00:45.810
That is download binary release or so score and retrieve so schooled from subversion.

00:45.810 --> 00:50.480
That is a C and will go to binary release.

00:50.580 --> 00:52.580
And here we have multiple options.

00:52.740 --> 00:57.800
That is only side of file or no setup just a zip.

00:58.100 --> 01:03.230
Main G W set up admin GW no setup.

01:03.600 --> 01:12.540
So you have to select Min GW setup this a download compiler as well as I D E so select this one go to

01:12.540 --> 01:18.360
the website that the source forge for downloading it will start downloading the set of finding

01:21.820 --> 01:22.630
it's downloaded.

01:22.660 --> 01:23.580
So let us start.

01:23.590 --> 01:25.140
Set of 5.

01:25.150 --> 01:31.760
Here it starts installation of code blocks See you next.

01:31.790 --> 01:32.690
And agree on

01:35.450 --> 01:37.550
and clicked.

01:37.550 --> 01:38.860
I agree.

01:39.020 --> 01:40.840
Next then.

01:40.880 --> 01:43.450
Here is a place where the code blocks will be installed.

01:43.460 --> 01:48.920
If you want to change their Derek do you can shipments and will start installation so it will extract

01:48.920 --> 01:52.910
all the files of I.T. and the compiler

01:57.160 --> 01:58.930
so do you want to run good blocks.

01:58.930 --> 01:59.280
No.

01:59.800 --> 02:00.810
So I say no.

02:00.850 --> 02:02.280
And let us finish this one.

02:02.290 --> 02:02.910
So next.

02:02.950 --> 02:03.910
And it is finish.

02:03.910 --> 02:04.780
It isn't started.

02:05.480 --> 02:10.090
No let us open the good blogs.

02:10.100 --> 02:11.550
Here is a quote blog window.

02:11.570 --> 02:13.970
Let us see how to start a new project.

02:13.970 --> 02:16.220
So first of all I want to show you will see language project.

02:16.230 --> 02:16.710
Then I will.

02:16.850 --> 02:20.760
Then again I will show you C++ project though the steps are same.

02:21.260 --> 02:27.560
But let us first create a project for C language so go to File menu and select new and in New select

02:27.560 --> 02:31.080
projects.

02:31.100 --> 02:37.340
It will pop up the various option select option cancel application so all our data structure programs

02:37.340 --> 02:43.130
will be developing as a console application say okay.

02:43.190 --> 02:48.890
Now here there is a prompt asking for language you can select a C or C++.

02:49.130 --> 02:51.620
So this is the only place where you can decide the language.

02:51.650 --> 02:54.570
So I will select C language that I see next.

02:54.620 --> 03:03.320
And here I have mentioned the project file name so I'll give the project name as my first C then.

03:03.320 --> 03:05.240
These are some project properties.

03:05.240 --> 03:06.220
Then skip that.

03:06.530 --> 03:13.130
And here is a project ready if you have a project window you can find the source code file that is main

03:13.140 --> 03:17.990
dot see if you double click a file will appear now.

03:18.110 --> 03:21.090
Main dot c is open.

03:21.110 --> 03:24.140
Now how to compile and run so you can go to the menu option.

03:24.140 --> 03:29.090
There is an option called Build and in that there are options available for compiling the program and

03:29.090 --> 03:31.790
running the program to can run or build a program.

03:32.150 --> 03:37.490
So here I will say simply run it will give a prompt asking for building the projects so you see yes

03:37.580 --> 03:39.480
I want to build a project.

03:39.770 --> 03:45.220
Here is a control window which is showing the hello world message that is given by a program.

03:45.500 --> 03:49.910
So if you run the program you'll be getting this controlled black colored window where your output will

03:49.910 --> 03:50.300
appear.

03:52.100 --> 03:57.230
If there are any errors in your program like say if I remove the semicolon and a fight on the program

03:57.260 --> 03:57.820
once again.

03:57.830 --> 03:59.080
So far running the program.

03:59.120 --> 04:01.680
Press Control F 10.

04:01.880 --> 04:03.280
Here you can see the option.

04:03.530 --> 04:04.560
Control f 10.

04:04.580 --> 04:09.720
So first of all I will build a program so rebuild the program.

04:09.740 --> 04:10.980
There is an error.

04:11.090 --> 04:14.040
See here in the log window it is showing an error message.

04:14.390 --> 04:19.610
So if there are an error messages you can see them at the bottom in the log window and you can remove

04:19.610 --> 04:21.100
those errors.

04:21.980 --> 04:22.820
So that's it.

04:22.820 --> 04:27.590
Next we will see how to start the C++ project for C++.

04:27.590 --> 04:32.240
I can google files and see a new project.

04:32.270 --> 04:40.010
I can start a new project and the project type that we have to select as console application and the

04:40.010 --> 04:44.540
language that you have to select a C++ and the project name.

04:44.540 --> 04:45.860
My first

04:48.840 --> 04:55.980
finish now here the project is created and in the source says this is a C++ file.

04:55.980 --> 04:57.860
Double click on it.

04:58.290 --> 04:59.810
And this is the source code file.

04:59.820 --> 05:06.000
So here is already some code is written so you can type your own code in displays and you can write

05:06.000 --> 05:07.590
all your programs here.

05:07.950 --> 05:13.370
See already I stream header files included and a namespace is also included here.

05:13.830 --> 05:19.530
So using namespace this hello world is displayed you can write all your programs here.

05:19.530 --> 05:24.930
That is using this main function and you can write your own functions or classes that will be learning

05:24.930 --> 05:25.920
slowly.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.290
So let us see how to run.

05:27.300 --> 05:34.040
So first you have to build this one so combine say build this project brilliant on the program so displays

05:34.340 --> 05:35.040
had a word.

05:35.640 --> 05:36.300
So that's it.

05:36.300 --> 05:40.210
So this is all you can download and use this idea.

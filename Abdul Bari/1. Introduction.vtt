WEBVTT

00:00.230 --> 00:03.690
Let us start with the introduction to data structures.

00:03.960 --> 00:08.940
Data is an integral part of core applications or programs.

00:08.940 --> 00:14.730
If I define a program program as nothing was set of instructions which perform operations on data to

00:14.730 --> 00:22.150
get some results so we don't get that it is more of instruction no use of instructions than the data

00:22.200 --> 00:23.500
dome dome data.

00:23.520 --> 00:29.880
We use it in many places like Data Structures databases data visit house big data.

00:30.300 --> 00:34.200
So from this what is actually data structure.

00:34.230 --> 00:38.960
So for this if we have a little bit knowledge about all other things also that would be better.

00:39.150 --> 00:45.810
So far so I'll start with data structures and we'll also have the brief introduction to databases and

00:45.810 --> 00:48.030
data of it holds as well as big data.

00:48.870 --> 00:52.670
So first let us start with Introduction to data structures.

00:52.740 --> 00:58.770
First of all let me introduce what is data structure data structure can be defined as arrangement of

00:58.890 --> 01:07.470
collection of data items so that they can utilize efficiently operations on that data can be done efficiently.

01:07.470 --> 01:14.310
So it's all about the arrangement of data and the operations on the data that are efficient operations

01:14.310 --> 01:14.920
on the data.

01:15.330 --> 01:20.250
But the question is where inside the main memory during the execution of a program.

01:21.300 --> 01:24.330
So without data structure that cannot be any application.

01:24.690 --> 01:29.820
Every application will have a set of instructions which will perform operations on data source data

01:29.820 --> 01:37.020
is mandatory then the data is kept inside them in memory the programs will be inside the main memory.

01:37.350 --> 01:44.210
So during the execution of a program how the program will manage data inside the main memory and performed

01:44.280 --> 01:45.260
operations.

01:45.300 --> 01:46.860
That is about a structure.

01:47.400 --> 01:55.670
So I'll take an example and explain you in detail how the program utilizes data and how they put that

01:55.670 --> 01:57.720
data inside them in memory.

01:57.720 --> 01:59.810
Let us look at this diagram.

02:00.420 --> 02:05.450
Here is a simple process that is central processing unit that is a microprocessor.

02:05.680 --> 02:07.170
And this is main memory.

02:07.170 --> 02:14.970
Let us say this is a ram and this is a storage that is hard disk drive or external storage or just call

02:14.970 --> 02:17.580
it storage.

02:17.580 --> 02:19.530
This will execute our programs.

02:19.560 --> 02:23.060
That is it is a process so it will execute the instructions.

02:23.830 --> 02:27.600
And this is temporary memory that is working memory.

02:27.610 --> 02:34.520
It is also called primary memory and this is permanent storage.

02:34.530 --> 02:36.040
This is permanent storage.

02:36.180 --> 02:42.630
So if we look into over B.C. then we will have a process of RAM and hard disk or if we look at it or

02:42.630 --> 02:43.520
a mobile phone.

02:43.550 --> 02:49.830
Then there will be a processor and there will be some RAM like 2G or 3G or 4G bill for them and there

02:49.830 --> 02:54.490
is a storage of 16 GBP 22 G.B. on wondering dude should be like this.

02:54.810 --> 03:01.410
That very day we keep all the programs when we install any program in our P.C. or on a lot of mobile

03:01.410 --> 03:06.210
phone program or an application will get installed on storage.

03:07.380 --> 03:12.540
So here I am showing it as a program final does the program fine.

03:13.050 --> 03:15.400
Then where do we keep our data.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.670
That box will keep it on hard disk.

03:17.670 --> 03:24.650
Suppose you have any pics or photos or videos or any documents that ball you keep it on your hard disk

03:24.850 --> 03:27.090
or a new mobile phone you keep it in storage.

03:28.020 --> 03:36.500
So these are data files so I take one example of a commonly used application like M.S. word.

03:36.640 --> 03:42.820
Most Windows users use a mouse word commonly used so there are not bad.

03:42.820 --> 03:50.980
Also you can assume that this is a must word program file and this is documented find out.

03:51.070 --> 03:52.550
Do you see X Files.

03:52.870 --> 03:56.480
And this is a Emma's word flight.

03:56.710 --> 04:02.770
Now to this example I'll explain you where the data structure comes into picture and how a Miss Ward

04:02.800 --> 04:04.420
may need a data structure.

04:04.420 --> 04:08.650
Now let us see how our application program runs.

04:09.250 --> 04:14.590
If you want to run a message board on your P.C. audio on mobile phone you are touching an icon or double

04:14.590 --> 04:19.190
clicking an icon of a mouse would then let us see what all happens.

04:19.390 --> 04:24.870
This award program will be brought into the mean memory so it isn't brought into the mean memory.

04:24.970 --> 04:32.500
So let's see these are all the instructions of this award program such as I'm showing lines to show

04:32.500 --> 04:37.210
though machine language code or instructions off a message board program.

04:37.210 --> 04:41.510
So whenever you want to run an application the application Gord or the program Gorda has to be brought

04:41.510 --> 04:42.900
into the main thing.

04:43.790 --> 04:49.900
Then once it is brought in Cebu will start executing this this word application so you will see a window

04:49.930 --> 04:55.430
appearing on the screen and then all the menu options everything comes up and you can start using this

04:55.530 --> 05:04.940
would know if you want to open a flight document find in your M.S. Ward application.

05:05.150 --> 05:09.480
Sometimes this program wants to access this data in this file.

05:09.490 --> 05:14.920
Then this data also has to be brought in to mean memory so literacy.

05:14.920 --> 05:16.140
This is the data.

05:16.210 --> 05:18.670
This is some word document fine.

05:19.090 --> 05:21.450
So data is also broke into the main memory.

05:21.470 --> 05:27.940
Now from this I can explain that I can say that our program has to be brought into the main memory for

05:27.940 --> 05:34.930
its execution as well as data has to be brought into the main memory for processing on the data so that

05:34.930 --> 05:39.790
these instructions can perform operation on their data program and get identically that ugly process

05:39.790 --> 05:41.500
the data keeping it on the storage.

05:41.500 --> 05:44.740
The data has to be brought into the meeting memory.

05:44.970 --> 05:53.680
Now from this we can say that every application deals with some data whether it is a mis word or if

05:53.680 --> 05:59.350
it is notepad then the notepad file text file has to be brought into the main memory if it is a girl

05:59.380 --> 06:02.460
your browsing an event page then that page.

06:02.460 --> 06:04.190
How many does coming from internet.

06:04.210 --> 06:06.040
It has to be in the mean memory.

06:06.040 --> 06:13.720
So every application on your computer system or any mobile phone deals with the same data and that data

06:13.720 --> 06:21.400
has to be inside main memory how you are denied the data inside the main memory so that it can be easily

06:21.400 --> 06:26.170
used by this application efficiently utilized by this application program.

06:26.710 --> 06:28.800
So how you organize their data.

06:28.990 --> 06:36.700
So the arrangement or organizing of the data inside the main memory for efficient utilization by the

06:36.970 --> 06:40.920
application that arrangement is called as a data structure.

06:41.560 --> 06:48.070
So data structures are formed in the mean memory during the execution time of a program.

06:48.070 --> 06:50.240
When the program runs it needs the data.

06:50.290 --> 06:55.460
So the question how it will arrange the data in the mean memory for performing its operations.

06:55.510 --> 07:02.160
So that arrangement is called s data structures so a data structure is a type of a running program.

07:02.180 --> 07:09.220
It may be doing different data structures like arrays or linkages or trees or hash table whatever the

07:09.220 --> 07:14.840
data structure is suitable application can use that particular data structure here for arranging its

07:14.880 --> 07:15.880
data.

07:16.070 --> 07:21.210
Data may be our text data or it might data like images or videos.

07:21.280 --> 07:26.460
Let us condense maybe there in the form of data so all those condense how they are organized in the

07:26.460 --> 07:27.520
main memory.

07:27.520 --> 07:35.530
So we have to design some data structure so that the application can use it perfectly or more efficiently

07:35.530 --> 07:39.610
an application should work faster or process faster or that data.

07:40.780 --> 07:41.770
So that's it.

07:41.770 --> 07:43.600
So I have given you the idea.

07:43.810 --> 07:46.390
What is data structure and and.

07:46.480 --> 07:48.930
It will be in your computer system.

07:49.300 --> 07:50.850
So it is not on the disk.

07:50.950 --> 07:52.390
It is inside the mean.

07:52.630 --> 07:56.930
So with all that structure we cannot develop any application.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.310
No let me give you some idea of old data business.

08:00.550 --> 08:08.350
See when that data is larger in size are coming to share data that is used in businesses like banks

08:08.410 --> 08:14.200
or retail stores or manufacturing farms they will have a lot of data and they will have some order that

08:14.220 --> 08:20.380
not easily adopt in the form of database tables or relational data unveiled to keep that relational

08:20.380 --> 08:23.300
data all of that data is stored on the disk.

08:23.620 --> 08:28.270
So I just remove this until you relational table that is kept on the disk.

08:28.270 --> 08:34.150
Now you can see here that on the disk on the hardest there's a table that every table I'm showing will

08:34.170 --> 08:35.280
only one table.

08:35.290 --> 08:36.330
There are many many tables.

08:36.330 --> 08:41.290
Data may be spread out across various database tables and is organized in the form of tables and the

08:41.290 --> 08:43.600
tables are having a relationship between them.

08:43.600 --> 08:48.740
So mostly come once your data is stored in the form of data tables.

08:48.740 --> 08:54.530
Now if any obligation program is using that database then data has to be brought into the main memory.

08:54.540 --> 08:55.720
Then only you can use it.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.840
So again you need a structure here.

08:57.970 --> 09:03.960
When you are pulling the data from the hard disk or from the storage to the mean memory during execution

09:04.000 --> 09:05.940
then you need definitely data structure.

09:06.700 --> 09:10.150
So arrangement of data here in the mean memories that structure.

09:10.270 --> 09:14.670
Then how does data is organize in the form of people on the disk.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.240
This is database.

09:16.240 --> 09:23.350
This is data just brief introduction I'm giving a database means arranging the data in some model like

09:23.350 --> 09:30.040
say a relational model in the bottom and in a storage so that it can be retrieved or to access by applications

09:30.190 --> 09:32.060
easily.

09:32.170 --> 09:35.180
That arrangement and the hardness are in the permanent storage.

09:35.200 --> 09:40.140
It's called us database then NICS.

09:40.160 --> 09:45.430
Let us go to the next strong like I was talking about commercial data.

09:45.530 --> 09:51.050
That is the data used in businesses so they will have a huge amount of data daily coming in.

09:51.170 --> 09:56.980
Like many customers are making transactions or lot of goods sort of manufactures and sold.

09:57.230 --> 10:03.650
So the data size will be growing day by day large and large so large sized data are very large data

10:03.680 --> 10:06.140
that may not be used for daily life.

10:06.240 --> 10:10.290
Like 1 year old a 10 year old data that could not be used now.

10:10.310 --> 10:17.570
So come on surely that can be categorized into two that is operational data or legacy data all the data

10:17.840 --> 10:27.130
operational data that is used that is daily and legacy data can be kept as storage is somewhere if required

10:27.370 --> 10:33.980
we can fetch that data and use it or you can see historical data so that historical data can be kept

10:34.130 --> 10:43.580
on a day off or disk because just imagine ten years of data or 50 years of data is kept on not just

10:43.580 --> 10:45.650
one disk of disk.

10:45.650 --> 10:52.750
So the last size data which is kept here that is acting as a historical data for any commercial form.

10:52.820 --> 10:55.010
This is data a hose

11:00.170 --> 11:04.600
this is a data warehouse so mostly commercial forms of hard data.

11:04.600 --> 11:05.780
Data warehouses.

11:06.080 --> 11:14.060
Dr. David Hose is helpful for analyzing the business or making the policies or starting a new trend

11:14.510 --> 11:21.560
or giving offers to the customers dealing with the customers so that the previous data all data will

11:21.560 --> 11:22.500
help.

11:22.580 --> 11:29.040
Automation and taking decisions so this large size data as data warehouse and the algorithms written

11:29.120 --> 11:36.410
for analyzing that data are data mining algorithms data mining algorithms.

11:36.740 --> 11:41.870
So whatever data is used I'm explaining a board that see this database.

11:41.890 --> 11:43.160
Right.

11:43.910 --> 11:45.710
Database.

11:45.890 --> 11:47.470
This is data structure.

11:50.730 --> 11:56.790
So a data structure inside the main memory during the execution database on the disk and large size

11:56.790 --> 12:03.090
data under huge size data which is inactive no and vendor required it is utilized.

12:03.090 --> 12:09.210
That is the W House and the last home that is big data is that term use nowadays

12:11.820 --> 12:17.190
big data with the start of it and there are huge sizes data is accumulating.

12:17.190 --> 12:24.960
Day by day in Internet that data is about all the things about the people about places lot of data is

12:24.960 --> 12:26.200
available in the Internet.

12:26.250 --> 12:34.080
And by analyzing that data we can take a lot of decisions that is for management for governance or for

12:34.080 --> 12:35.190
businesses.

12:35.250 --> 12:38.620
Analysis is very useful about that data.

12:38.850 --> 12:47.450
Storing and utilizing that very large sized data that study is big data that studies big data now.

12:47.580 --> 12:51.020
For a beginner these are maybe confusing Don.

12:51.050 --> 12:56.980
So I have some greatly defined them where each is use.

12:56.980 --> 13:02.220
Again ATP did not structure doesn't mean memory during the execution of a program arrangement of data

13:02.220 --> 13:09.930
here an arrangement of data on the disk as database arrangement of data in the array of disk as data

13:10.020 --> 13:10.830
it holds.

13:10.830 --> 13:12.730
That is not operational.

13:12.810 --> 13:17.710
That is not used for day to day and the big data that is used in Internet.

13:17.850 --> 13:22.380
So that's what I have given you the different places where data is use.

13:22.380 --> 13:24.660
Now our subject is a data structures.

13:24.750 --> 13:26.780
So let us start with data structures.

13:26.850 --> 13:27.960
Next video onwards.

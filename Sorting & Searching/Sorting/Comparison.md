Insertion Sort
```
```
1. Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands.

2. It is a stable sorting algorithm.

3. The best-case time complexity is O(N) when the array is already in ascending order.

4. It is more efficient than the Selection sort.

5. The number of comparison operations is less for sorting.

Selection Sort
```
```
1. Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that selects the smallest/largest element from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that 
element at the beginning of the unsorted list for  ascending / descending order.

2. It is an unstable sorting algorithm.

3. The best-case time complexity is O(N^2) when the array is already in ascending order.

4. It is less efficient than the Insertion sort.

5. The number of comparison operations is more for sorting.

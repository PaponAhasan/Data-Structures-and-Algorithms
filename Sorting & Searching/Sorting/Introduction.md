**Fast and works with C++**

-   Performance matching C++ using LLVM, with low-level access to bits and
    addresses
-   Interoperate with your existing C++ code, from inheritance to templates
-   Fast and scalable builds that work with your existing C++ build systems

**Modern and evolving**

-   Solid language foundations that are easy to learn, especially if you have
    used C++
-   Easy, tool-based upgrades between Carbon versions
-   Safer fundamentals, and an incremental path towards a memory-safe subset

**Welcoming open-source community**

-   Clear goals and priorities with robust governance
-   Community that works to be welcoming, inclusive, and friendly
-   Batteries-included approach: compiler, libraries, docs, tools, package
    manager, and more

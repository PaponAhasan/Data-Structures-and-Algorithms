Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that selects the smallest element from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that 
element at the beginning of the unsorted list.

2. Compare minimum with the remaining elements. Compare minimum with the second element, third element and so on. The process 
goes on until the last element.

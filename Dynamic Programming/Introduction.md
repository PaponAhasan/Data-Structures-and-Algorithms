Dynamic programming, or DP, is an approach to solving problems through 'clever bruteforce'.
It is a technique that combines the 
- Correctness of complete search and (if at least one solution exists then the algorithm is guaranteed find a solution in a finite amount of time.)
- The efficiency of greedy algorithms (Greedy algorithms try to find a localized optimum solution)

N.T : Dynamic programming can be applied if the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently.

 <br/>
 
  ```
  A brute force approach is an approach that finds all the possible solutions to find a satisfactory solution to a given problem.
  ```
  ##### Disadvantages
  ```
  - It is an inefficient algorithm 
  - It is a very slow algorithm to find the correct solution
  - The brute force algorithm is neither constructive nor creative

There are two uses for dynamic programming:
   * Yes/No Question (Greedy)
   * Finding an optimal solution : You want to find a solution that is as large as possible or as small as possible.(Greedy)
   * Counting the number of solutions : You want to calculate the total number of possible solutions. (Combination)
```

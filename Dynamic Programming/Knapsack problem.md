The 0/1 knapsack problem is a classical dynamic programming problem.

We have a bag of given capacity C. We need to pack n items in the bag. Each item has a value v and weight w. The objective is to 
maximize the profit.

- The capacity of the bag is C.

- We have n items.

- The ith item has value vi and weight wi.

- Our target is to maximize the profit by taking the most valuable items but we can not exceed the bag capacity C.

- We can either carry an item or can not carry it. 

- We can not take an item more than once.

Example : 
  Suppose we have a bag of maximum capacity C = 8units.
  We have a total of n = 4 items to choose from.
  The values of each item are given as a list v = [1, 2, 5, 6] and 
  Their corresponding weights are given as a list w = [2, 3, 4, 5].
  Since this is a 0/1 knapsack problem, we can either include an item in the bag or can not include it.
  We need to take the items in such a way so that the total profit is maximized and 
  The total weight of items taken is less than or equal to the capacity C.

1. Naive Approach : We can solve this problem naively with a recursive backtracking-based solution. By generating all possible 
configurations of different pieces and finding the maximum among them, we can get our optimal solution.

Time Complexity: Exponential
Space Complexity: O(1) if recursion stack space is not considered

2. Memoization Based Approach  (top down approach): Fig Memoization, The recursion as normal, but store the result of the
recursive calls, and if we need the result in a future recursive call.

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(n)

3. Iterative Dynamic Programming Approach (Bottom up approach): Similar to the memoization approach, we can also solve this problem 
using tabulation-based Dynamic Programming. But you donâ€™t have to keep a recursive call stack.

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(n)

Q : How to identify that a problem can be solved by Dynamic Programming?

A : A problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming if it contains some 'Optimal Substructure' and 'Overlapping Subproblems'.

```
The time complexity of the solution is O(n.w) and requires O(n.w) extra space.

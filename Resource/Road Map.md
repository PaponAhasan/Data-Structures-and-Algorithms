If you rating is steadily going down, doesn't mean you haven't been improving; it just means relative to others you haven't been doing as well. So don't give up hope just yet. 
Here's a quick rundown on how to get better at coding, which will eventually turn into an increase in rating.

1. Forget about rating. 
2. Attempt C/D first instead of A/B.
3. Upsolve the problems after contest (MUST, MUST and MUST)
4. Try to solve at least two problems a week that is out of your comfort zone.
5. Donâ€™t look at the standings during contest time.

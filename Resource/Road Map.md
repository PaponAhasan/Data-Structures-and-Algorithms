Tips:
good resources as well. Geeksforgeeks, emaxx, competitive
programming 3, Mahbubul Hasan Shanto vai’s book on programming contest,
Shafaet Ashraf vai’s blog.

Spend around an hour or two at each problem before searching for solutions
online. Learn to think in a IDA* approach,

After seeing the solution to a problem, make sure to understand the solution fully
and absolutely
There should be no doubt regarding anything with the solution,
and if there is, that means you have not understood it fully/internalized it. Problem
solving is more about pattern matching,

You should spend most of times on thinking about problems. You can
also think about problems when eating, bathing or even before sleeping

Upsolve problems after attending online contest

If you rating is steadily going down, doesn't mean you haven't been improving; it just means relative to others you haven't been doing as well. So don't give up hope just yet. 
Here's a quick rundown on how to get better at coding, which will eventually turn into an increase in rating.

1. Forget about rating. 
2. Attempt C/D first instead of A/B.
3. Upsolve the problems after contest (MUST, MUST and MUST)
4. Try to solve at least two problems a week that is out of your comfort zone.
5. Don’t look at the standings during contest time.

# Search Algorithms
```
Searching is a common problem asked in programming. The most naive way of performing searches would be linear search. Here, we 
introduce two faster searching algorithms :

  - Binary Search and
  - Ternary Search
```

## Binary Search
```
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. Binary Search is used to search in sorted
values in logarithmic time. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list.

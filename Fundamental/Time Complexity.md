### Complexity

```
Time and space complexity analysis is an important part of problem solving. All programming problems have a time limit and a 
memory limit.If your solution is logically 'correct', it may not meet these requirements.
- Time complexity is the number of steps/operations your algorithm takes to finish executing a given input. 
- Space complexity is the amount of space your algorithm can occupy when it runs on a given input.
```

```
The Big-O notation is used to describe how an algorithm scales with the size of the input.

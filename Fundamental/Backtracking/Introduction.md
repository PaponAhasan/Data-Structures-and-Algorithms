A backtracking algorithm is a problem-solving algorithm that uses a brute force approach for finding the desired output.

The term backtracking suggests that if the current solution is not suitable, then backtrack and try other solutions.Backtracking
is used when you have multiple solution and you want all those solution. Thus, recursion is used in this approach.

Example : If ther are three student two boys and girl (B1,B2,G1) and ther are three sits.
we have to arrange them in those three sits. How many way we can arrange.
Number are student are 3, arrange them 3! = 6 ways possibilities.
Now we find out all possible arrangement. For finding all possible all possible arrangement solution
can represent in the form of a tree (state space tree).

[A space state tree is a tree representing all the possible states (solution or nonsolution) of the problem from 
the root as an initial state to the leaf as a terminal state.]

```
 6 operators are bitwise operators
 1. The & (bitwise AND) : The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1, otherwise 0.
 2. The | (bitwise OR) :  The result of OR is 0 if both bits are 0, otherwise 1. 
 3. The ^ (bitwise XOR) : The result of XOR is 1 if the two bits are different(0/1), otherwise 0.
 4. The << (left shift) : Left shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift. 
 5. The >> (right shift) : Right shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift. 
 6. The ~ (bitwise NOT) : Takes one number and inverts all bits of it.

### Bit Manipulation
```
Bit : A bit (short for binary digit) is the smallest unit of data in a computer. A bit has a single binary value, either 0 or 1.
There are different bitwise operations used in the bit manipulation. Bit operations are fast and can be used in optimizing time 
complexity.

NOT ( ~ )
AND ( & )
OR ( | )
XOR ( ^ )
Left Shift ( << )
Right Shift ( >> )

```
11        odd      1
11/2 = 5  odd      1
5/2 = 2   even     0
2/2 = 1   odd      1
1/2 = 0

So binary(11) = 1101

### Bit Manipulation
```
Bit : A bit (short for binary digit) is the smallest unit of data in a computer. A bit has a single binary value, either 0 or 1.
There are different bitwise operations used in the bit manipulation. Bit operations are fast and can be used in optimizing time 
complexity.

NOT ( ~ )
AND ( & )
OR ( | )
XOR ( ^ )
Left Shift ( << )
Right Shift ( >> )

```
11        odd      1
11/2 = 5  odd      1
5/2 = 2   even     0
2/2 = 1   odd      1
1/2 = 0

So binary(11) = 1101
7 -> (MSB)1101(LSB)

```
2 two 1 otherwise 0 -> AND
2 two 0 otherwise 1 -> OR
Same bit 0 otherwise 1 -> X-OR

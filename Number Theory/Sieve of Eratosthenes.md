Find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n( when n = 50) by the Eratostheneâ€™s method.
```
```
We create a list of all numbers from 2 to 50.

```
According to the algorithm we will mark all the numbers which are divisible by 2 and are greater than or equal to the square of it.

```
Now we move to our next unmarked number 3 and mark all the numbers which are multiples of 3 and are greater than or equal to the
square of it.

```
We move to our next unmarked number 5 and mark all multiples of 5 and are greater than or equal to the square of it.
```

```
We continue this process and our final table will look like below:

```
So the prime numbers are the unmarked ones: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.

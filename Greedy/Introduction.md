A Greedy algorithm is one of the problem-solving methods which takes optimal solution in each step.

- The Greedy algorithm attempts to take the best in each step and it doesn't care about the overall result.

- Greedy Approach - "Living in the present. Don't overthink about the future".

- This is not an algorithm, it is a technique.

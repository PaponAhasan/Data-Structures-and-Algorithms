Hash tables use a technique 

- To generate these unique index numbers for each value stored in an array format. This technique is called the hash technique.

- Mapping a large chunk of data into small tables using a hashing function.

- You only need to find the index of the desired item, rather than finding the data. With indexing, you can quickly scan the 
  entire list and retrieve the item you wish.
  
- Efficiently finding and storing data in an array.

[ Indexing also helps in inserting operations when you need to insert data at a specific location. No matter how big or small the 
table is, you can update and retrieve data within seconds. ]
```

### Examples
```
- In schools, the teacher assigns a unique roll number to each student. Later, the teacher uses that roll number to retrieve 
information about that student.

- A library has an infinite number of books. The librarian assigns a unique number to each book. This unique number helps in 
identifying the position of the books on the bookshelf.
```

### Advantage
```
- A good hash function is easy to compute.

- A good hash function avoids collision when two elements or items get assigned to the same hash value.

- Hashing uses this unique index to perform insert, update, and search operations.

- Efficiently finding and storing data in an array.
```

### Hashing in Works?
```
- Hashing in data structure uses hash tables to store the key-value pairs.

- The key acts as an input to the hashing function.

- Hashing function then generates a unique index number for each value stored.

- The index number keeps the value that corresponds to that key. 

- The hash function returns a small integer value as an output.

Hash tables use a technique 
- To generate these unique index numbers for each value stored in an array format. This technique is called the hash technique. 
- Mapping a large chunk of data into small tables using a hashing function.
- You only need to find the index of the desired item, rather than finding the data. With indexing, you can quickly scan the 
  entire list and retrieve the item you wish.
- Efficiently finding and storing data in an array.

### Examples
```
- In schools, the teacher assigns a unique roll number to each student. Later, the teacher uses that roll number to retrieve 
information about that student.

- A library has an infinite number of books. The librarian assigns a unique number to each book. This unique number helps in 
identifying the position of the books on the bookshelf.

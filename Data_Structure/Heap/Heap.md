###  Binary Heaps
```
A Heap is a complete binary tree-based data structure with a specific ordering property.

There are two types: 
  * Max-Heap: The key present at any node is greater than the keys present at both of its children. The largest key is at the
    root node.
  * Min-Heap: The key present at any node is smaller than the keys present at both of its children. The smallest key is at the
    root node.
```

```
Heaps are used when the highest or lowest order/priority element needs to be removed. They allow quick access to this item in
O(1) time. One use of a heap is to implement a priority queue.

A priority queue is a data structure, usually implemented using heaps, that supports finding max (or min) element in O(1) along 
with insertions and deletions in O(logn).

### Heap Operations

 ```
  Heapify is the process of creating a heap data structure from a binary tree. It is used to create a Min-Heap or a Max-Heap.

```
An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type 
together.

- This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element.

- Array has a fixed size meaning once the size is given to it, it cannot be changed.
   i.e. you canâ€™t shrink it neither can you expand it.

```
Advantages :

1. Arrays allow random access to elements. This makes accessing elements by position faster.

2. Arrays have better cache locality that makes a pretty big difference in performance.

3. Arrays represent multiple data items of the same type using a single name.

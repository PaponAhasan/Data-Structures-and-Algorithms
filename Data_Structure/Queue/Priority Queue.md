### Priority Queue

An ascending order priority queue gives the highest priority to the lower number in that queue. A priority queue is an abstract data-type similar to a regular queue or stack data structure in which each element additionally has a "priority" associated with it. In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority.

Graphs are mathematical structures that represent pairwise relationships between objects. It can be visualized by using the 
following two basic components:

- Nodes/Vertex/Point/Junction: One of the points on which the graph is defined and which may be connected by lines/edges is 
  called a vertex.
- Edges/Lines: Edge is the connection between two vertices. Each edge connects one vertex to another vertex in the graph. 
  Edge can either be directed or undirected.

Types of nodes :

- Root node:
- Leaf nodes:

Types of graphs:

- Null Graph : A null graph is a graph in which there are no edges between its vertices. A null graph is also called empty graph.
- Trivial Graph : A trivial graph is the graph which has only one vertex.
- Undirected:  A directed edge is the edge which points from one vertex to another.
- Directed: An undirected edge has no direction from one vertex to another.
- Complete Graph : A graph in which every pair of vertices is joined by exactly one edge is called complete graph.
- Weighted: A weighted graph is a graph whose edges have been labeled with some weights or numbers.
- Cyclic: A graph containing at least one cycle in it is known as a cyclic graph. In the cycle graph, degree of each vertex is 2.
- Acyclic Graph : A graph which does not contain any cycle in it is called as an acyclic graph.
- Connected Graph : A connected graph is a graph in which we can visit from any one vertex to any other vertex.
- Disconnected Graph : A disconnected graph is a graph in which any path does not exist between every pair of vertices.
- Regular Graph : A Regular graph is a graph in which degree of all the vertices is same.
- Bipartite Graph :

```
A spanning tree is a sub-graph of an undirected connected graph, which includes all the vertices of the graph with a minimum 
possible number of edges. If a vertex is missed, then it is not a spanning tree.

|V| = N Vertices
|E| = |V| - 1 = N - 1 Edges
```
**An undirected graph is a graph in which the edges do not point in any direction (ie. edges are bidirectional).**

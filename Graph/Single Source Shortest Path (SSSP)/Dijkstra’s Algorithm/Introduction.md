```
Dijkstra's algorithm allows us to find the shortest path between any two vertices of a graph. It's solves the single-source 
shortest path problem with non-negative edge weight.

It differs from the minimum spanning tree because the shortest distance between two vertices might not include all the vertices of
the graph.

- Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path between a given node (which is called the "source node") and all other nodes in a 
  graph.
- This algorithm uses the weights of the edges to find the path that minimizes the total distance (weight) between the source node 
  and all other nodes.

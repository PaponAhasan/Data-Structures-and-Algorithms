A brute force approach is an approach that finds all the possible solutions to find a satisfactory solution to a given 
problem. The brute force algorithm tries out all the possibilities till a satisfactory solution is not found.

Brute force algorithm is a technique that guarantees solutions for problems and helps in solving the simpler problems. But 
takes a lot of run time and inefficient. For real-time problems, algorithm analysis often goes above the O(N!) order of growth.
Brute force algorithms are slow.
